This Python script is a **basic multithreaded HTTP request flooder**, which continuously sends requests to a given URL using 100 threads. It's a very simplified form of a **Denial of Service (DoS) attack simulation**, intended for **educational or testing purposes** on a **server you control**, like a local Flask server (`http://127.0.0.1`).

---

### üö® **‚ö†Ô∏è Disclaimer**

**Never use this code on servers or networks you do not own or have explicit permission to test. Unauthorized DoS attacks are illegal and unethical.**

---

### üîç **Detailed Explanation**

#### 1. **Imports**

```python
import threading
import requests
```

* `threading`: Used to run multiple threads simultaneously, allowing concurrent execution.
* `requests`: A Python library to send HTTP requests easily.

---

#### 2. **Target URL**

```python
target_url = "http://127.0.0.1"
```

* This is the IP address for **localhost**, meaning the attack is aimed at your own machine (usually a Flask development server).
* Replace with a different IP or domain only if **you own** that server and intend to test it.

---

#### 3. **Attack Function**

```python
def attack():
    while True:
        try:
            response = requests.get(target_url)
            print(f"Sent request, response: {response.status_code}")
        except requests.exceptions.RequestException:
            print("Server Down!")
```

* This function **runs in an infinite loop**, constantly sending GET requests to the `target_url`.
* If the server responds, it prints the HTTP status code (e.g., 200 OK).
* If there's a failure (e.g., connection refused), it prints **"Server Down!"** ‚Äî indicating the server might be overwhelmed or offline.

---

#### 4. **Creating 100 Threads**

```python
for _ in range(100):
    thread = threading.Thread(target=attack)
    thread.start()
```

* This loop **spawns 100 threads**, each running the `attack()` function.
* That means 100 simultaneous infinite loops sending requests ‚Äî a **flood of traffic**.

---

### üí• **What This Code Does**

* Launches a **high volume of HTTP requests** to a target URL using 100 threads.
* This can **exhaust server resources**, leading to:

  * **High CPU usage**
  * **Memory spikes**
  * **Request timeouts or dropped connections**
  * **Total server crash (DoS)** if unprotected

---

### üõ†Ô∏è **Safe Usage Example**

You could test this against your own local Flask app:

```bash
# Run in separate terminal:
from flask import Flask
app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route("/")
def home():
    return "Hello"

app.run(port=80)
```

Then run your script to see how your server handles high traffic.

---

### üß© **Potential Improvements or Variants**

* Use `thread.daemon = True` to allow clean exit.
* Add a delay (`time.sleep`) to simulate less aggressive traffic.
* Change HTTP method (`POST`, `PUT`, etc.).
* Add headers or payloads to simulate more realistic requests.

A **DDoS (Distributed Denial of Service)** attack is a type of cyberattack where **multiple systems** (often hundreds or thousands) are used to **flood a target system**, like a website or server, with **an overwhelming amount of traffic**, causing it to slow down, crash, or become completely unavailable.

---

### üîç **What DDoS Does**

In simple terms, a DDoS attack:

* Sends **huge volumes of fake or excessive requests** to a server or network.
* **Exhausts system resources** (CPU, memory, bandwidth).
* **Disrupts normal user access** by slowing down or crashing the target.
* Aims to **take services offline** or degrade performance.

---

### üí£ **How It Works (Simplified)**

1. **Attacker controls a botnet** ‚Äì a network of compromised computers or IoT devices infected with malware.
2. All these bots are **remotely instructed** to send traffic (like HTTP requests, pings, etc.) to a specific server.
3. The target becomes **overloaded** and can‚Äôt respond to legitimate users.

### ‚öôÔ∏è **Types of DDoS Attacks**

| Type                            | Description                                                                          |
| ------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Volumetric**                  | Flood the target with large amounts of traffic (e.g., UDP flood, DNS amplification). |
| **Protocol-based**              | Exploit weaknesses in protocols like TCP, ICMP, or DNS (e.g., SYN flood).            |
| **Application-layer (Layer 7)** | Target specific services like HTTP/HTTPS by mimicking real users.                    |

---

### üß™ **Effects of a DDoS Attack**

* üåê Website goes down or becomes very slow
* üí∏ Business loses revenue or customers
* üö® Alarms trigger on network monitoring tools
* üîí Security and IT teams scramble to mitigate

---

### üõ°Ô∏è **Defenses Against DDoS**

* **Rate limiting** (restrict how many requests a user can make)
* **Firewalls & intrusion detection systems**
* **Content delivery networks (CDNs)** like Cloudflare or Akamai
* **Traffic scrubbing services**
* **Anycast networks** to distribute the load

---

### üß© **DDoS vs DoS**

| Term     | Stands for                    | Difference                                       |
| -------- | ----------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| **DoS**  | Denial of Service             | Single source overloads the target               |
| **DDoS** | Distributed Denial of Service | Many sources (botnet) attack the target together |

---

### ‚ö†Ô∏è **Legal Note**

* **Launching a DDoS attack is illegal** in most countries, including under laws like the **Computer Fraud and Abuse Act (USA)** or **IT Act (India)**.
* Always perform stress testing **only on systems you own or are authorized to test.**
